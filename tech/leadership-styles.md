## Commanding: "Do it because I say so"

This leadership style is also known as: **Autocratic, Directive, Coercive.**

The **_Commanding Leader_** unilaterally takes complete control of the situation, dictates what and how is something going to be done and assumes the responsibility entirely.

This style is not recommended to be used long-term, but it can be useful when confronting a crisis or when dealing with problematic people.

## Pacesetting: "Do it my way"

The **_Pacesetting Leader_** focuses on reaching goals and performance. This Leader expects excellence from the team and when could sometimes jump in to make sure the goals are met.

We could use this style when we need some quick results, but is doesn't create a great environment in the long-run.

Objective: Collaboration, commitment and generating new ideas.
