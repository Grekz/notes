# The Three Amigos


__What is The Three Amigos?__

It's a series of articles written by two developers and a product person working together creating experiences through design and tech. We will try explaining as transparent as possible how we work together, what are our challenges and what we are doing to keep improving the way we work. We will also be posting articles going deep into certain tech and product topics that we are passionate about.

__Why we are starting this project?__

This project started with the desire of improving our communication skills. The three of us are native Spanish speakers and even if we use English on our day to day at work, we still see there is lots of room for improvement. 

Hopefully, writing a few lines not only will help us communicate better but would also be helpful for any team out there wanting to work together better every day.

__Starting conversations__

We think that the conversations coming out from these posts will be the most fun and valuable for us. So, please don't be shy and post your comments or reach to us through Twitter.

Thanks,
Adan, Jokin & Juan
